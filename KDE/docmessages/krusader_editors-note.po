"As you may notice, this handbook is written by various authors. The draft "
"explanation of new features is done by the developers on the krusader-devel "
"mailinglist, the editors add this information in this handbook. We have "
"taken much care in ensuring technical and vocabulary consistency. The "
"authors write in English even though it is not their native language; "
"therefore, you may notice strange sentence constructions. Do not hesitate to "
"let us know, if something is not clear to you."
