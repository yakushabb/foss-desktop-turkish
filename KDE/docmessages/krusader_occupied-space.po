"To calculate how much disk space is occupied by the selected files and "
"folders in the active panel select <menuchoice> <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> "
"<guimenuitem>Calculate Occupied Space</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>. After a "
"small delay, a dialog box will be displayed with total occupied space and "
"the number of files and folders you selected. The space occupied by every "
"selected folder will be shown as if the user just pressed configurable "
"shortcut on those folders. If the active panel is browsing an archive, the "
"numbers will apply to the unpacked size of the selected files and folders, "
"not their compressed size. After the calculation the selection state will be "
"toggled and the cursor will move one step downwards."
