"Welcome to &krusader;'s powerful search module - nicknamed KruSearcher. It "
"is the most able tool (that we know of) for &Linux;, since it allows so many "
"different ways to quickly find the file you are looking for. The search "
"function is also available on remote file systems. It is divided into two "
"levels, the general and the advanced. Let's take a look at the general page."
