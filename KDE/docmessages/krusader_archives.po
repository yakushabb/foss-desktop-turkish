"The <link linkend=\"vfs\">Virtual file systems (VFS)</link> allows you to "
"browse archives as if it was a folder. Currently &krusader; supports the "
"following archives types: ace, arj, bzip2, deb, gzip, iso, lha, rar, rpm, "
"tar, xz, zip, and 7-zip and supports the following passworded archives: arj, "
"ace, rar and zip. Passwords can be stored in <application>KWallet</"
"application>. Please note that the archive support first needs to be "
"properly <link linkend=\"konfig-archives\">configured</link> in "
"Konfigurator. To open the archive, use &Enter; key, (double-)click or the "
"&Right; key. &krusader; supports also <emphasis role=\"bold\">hidden "
"archives</emphasis>, these are renamed archives with a *wrong* extension, "
"&eg; <trademark class=\"registered\">OpenOffice</trademark> uses zip "
"archives with the following extensions: <literal role=\"extension\">.odt</"
"literal>, <literal role=\"extension\">.sxw</literal> and <literal role="
"\"extension\">.odw</literal>. &Enter; will open the <trademark class="
"\"registered\">OpenOffice</trademark> document and the &Right; key will open "
"the archive. Another example is J2EE, where the <literal role=\"extension\">."
"jar</literal> extension means a zip archive. Since &krusader; auto-detects "
"the supported archive types, it will open with &Right; key even if it has "
"another &MIME; type. Please note that browsing archives has a few "
"limitations:"
